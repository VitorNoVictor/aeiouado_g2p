aeiouado_g2p
============

##Overview
**aeiouado_g2p** is a grapheme-to-phoneme converter for Brazilian Portuguese, based on the dialect of SÃ£o Paulo (city). It was designed primarily for Speech Technologies, such as Automatic Speech Recognition Systems and Speech Synthesizers. However, it may also be used by linguists, speech therapists, lexicographers, students of Brazilian Portuguese as a second language, and whoever is interested in the sound structure of Brazilian Portuguese.

##Technical Information
**aeiouado_g2p** makes use of a hybrid approach for converting graphemes into phonemes, which takes advantage of both manual transcription rules and machine learning algorithms. The transcription task is carried out in a two-step process: 

1. Words are submitted to a set of transcription rules, in which predictable graphemes (mostly consonants) are transcribed; 
2. a machine learning classifier is used to predict the transcription of the remaining graphemes (mostly vowels). 

The classifier employs a Decision Tree to decide, given a certain grapheme, which phone should be transcribed. The method was evaluated through 5-fold cross-validation; results showed a F1-score of 0.98.
